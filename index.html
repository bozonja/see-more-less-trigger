          JavaScript (often shortened to JS) is a lightweight, interpreted,
          object-oriented language with first-class functions, and is best known
          as the scripting language for Web pages, but it's used in many
          non-browser environments as well. It is a prototype-based,
          multi-paradigm scripting language that is dynamic, and supports
          object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming styles.
          JavaScript runs on the client side of the web, which can be used to
          design / program how the web pages behave on the occurrence of an
          event. JavaScript is an easy to learn and also powerful scripting
          language, widely used for controlling web page behavior.
